# dotfiles

A collection of commonly used utilities for sharing across computers. Includes,
for example, shell scripts and styles.

For installation, see: https://github.com/ivakyb/fish_ssh_agent

## TODO

* ~~Some fish scripts have a hardcoded `~/code/dotfiles` path, and this should
  probably be changed to a variable path.~~ Think this is fixed?
